  "recommended_action": "The password for user root must be changed now to access the system. For example, to apply a new password to a user, invoke the following NSX API with a valid password in the request body: PUT /api/v1/node/users/<userid> where <userid> is the ID of the user. If the admin user (with <userid> 10000) password has expired, admin must login to the system via SSH (if enabled) or console in order to change the password. Upon entering the current expired password, admin will be prompted to enter a new password."
